Variable Ordering for Decision Diagrams: A Portfolio Approach	Talk	cpaior-dd	CPAIOR	2021-07-07	Virtual	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGrsh6AWldQ	Studying the use of portfolios of variable orderings on the performance of a decision diagram based algorithm for finding graph coloring lower bounds
Graph Coloring With Decision Diagrams: An Analysis Of
Variable Ordering	Talk	informs-dd	INFORMS Annual Conference	2021-10-25	Anaheim, CA	_	A decision diagram approach was recently introduced to generate lower bounds
for the graph coloring problem. It uses compilation via iterative refinement,
which requires a variable ordering to be specified in advance. Oftentimes no
single variable ordering dominates all others for a set of problem instances. This
work provides an analysis and experimental evaluation of different variable
ordering strategies including using portfolios of variable orderings.
Graph Coloring using Decision Diagrams with Zykov Branching	Talk	ics-dd	INFORMS Computing Society Conference	2022-01-25	Tampa Bay, FL	_	A recent work by van Hoeve introduced a decision diagram based iterative refinement algorithm for
finding multi-path solutions to optimization problems. We study the addition of branch and bound to this algorithm, including the well-known Zykov branching rule for graph coloring.
