Hi - my name is Anthony Karahalios. In Fall 2020, I started in the [Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO) PhD program](https://aco.math.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am very fortunate to be advised by the wonderful [Willem-Jan van Hoeve](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/van-hoeve-willem-jan.html).

I research exact methods for solving discrete optimization problems. I model these problems with tools from Integer Programming and Decision Diagrams / Dynamic Programming. I develop algorithms to solve these models and study their computational performance. In my research, I have solved benchmark instances and real-world instances of vehicle routing problems, scheduling problems, picking problems in Amazon fulfillment centers, and a humanitarian logistics problem in Turkiye.

I intend to graduate in May 2025, and I am currently on the Academic Job Market. [CV](https://amkarahalios.github.io/files/CV.pdf)

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to reach out!
