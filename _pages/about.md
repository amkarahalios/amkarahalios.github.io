Hi - my name is Anthony Karahalios. I am an Operations Research scientist, and I enjoy researching optimization methodologies, teaching optimization, and writing software that use optimization to solve real-world problems.

My journey:
1. B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins (2014-2017)
   - Solved umpire crew scheduling problems for Minor League Baseball
2. Quantiative Developer for Marshall Wace (2017-2020)
   - Worked on an automated trading system and built a cash and custodian optimizer
3. Ph.D in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (2020 - expected May 2025)
   - Developed column elimination - a novel discrete optimization method that performs well on large-scale vehicle routing problems. I am advised by [Willem-Jan van Hoeve](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/van-hoeve-willem-jan.html).

I am graduating soon! Checkout my [CV](https://amkarahalios.github.io/files/CV.pdf) to see if I am a good fit for your school or company.

Thanks for visiting, and feel free to reach out.
