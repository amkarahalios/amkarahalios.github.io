Welcome to my home page. I am a 2nd year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University working with Professor Willem-Jan van Hoeve.

My research interests are mainly in combinatorial optimization and integer programming. Recently I have been working on using decision diagrams to solve the graph coloring problem.

My hobbies include chess, dance, poetry, athletics, and piano.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to reach out!
