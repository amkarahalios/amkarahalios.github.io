Hi - my name is Anthony Karahalios. I am an Operations Research scientist, and I enjoy researching optimization methodologies, teaching optimization, and writing software that uses optimization to solve real-world problems.

My journey:
1. B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins (2014-2017)
   - Solved umpire crew scheduling problems for Minor League Baseball.
2. Quantiative Developer for Marshall Wace (2017-2020)
   - Worked on an automated trading system and built a treasury optimization system.
3. Ph.D in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (2020 - expected May 2025)
   - Developed a novel discrete optimization method that performs well on large-scale vehicle routing problems. I am advised by [Willem-Jan van Hoeve](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/van-hoeve-willem-jan.html).

Side-projects:
1. An algorithm that uses SAT to solve vertex coloring problems.
2. A quantum-inspired algorithm to solve a humanitarian logistics network design problem.
3. A dyadic linear programming solver.
4. An exact method for solving a multi-objective parts-to-picker problem in Amazon Robotics warehouses.

My skills:
1. Optimization
   - Coursework in Linear Programming, Integer Programming, Convex Optimization, Constraint Programming, Algorithms, Discrete Mathemaics, SAT solvers, Extremal Combinatorics
2. Optimization Software
   - Experience with Gurobi, Hexaly, CPLEX, XPRESS, PuLP, Mosek, SAT solvers, CP solvers, VRP solvers
3. Software Development
   - Proficient in C++ and Python, familiar with Java, C#, MATLAB, Julia, R.

Some awards:
1. CPAIOR Best Student Paper (2023)
2. IPCO Best Poster Honorable Mention (2023)
3. NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (2022)
4. JHU Professor Joel Dean Award for Excellence in Teaching (2016,2017)
5. Sigma Chi International Balfour Award Finalist (2017)

Fun things:
1. I host a podcast called [Optimizing You](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1890697)
2. I was involved with a charity called the [All Stars Project Development School for Youth](https://allstars.org/our-work/programs/development-school-for-youth/).
3. I work as a freelancer on [Upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~019b8adcf84c4cd492?mp_source=share)
4. I was president of the [CMU INFORMS Student Chapter](https://cmuinforms.org/) and chair of [YinzOR 2022](https://yinzor.cmuinforms.org/program/)

I am graduating soon! Checkout my [CV](https://amkarahalios.github.io/files/CV.pdf) to see if I am a good fit for your school or company.
