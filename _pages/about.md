Hi - my name is Anthony Karahalios. In Fall 2020, I started in the [Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO) PhD program](https://aco.math.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am very fortunate to be advised by the wonderful [Willem-Jan van Hoeve](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/van-hoeve-willem-jan.html).

I research exact methods for solving discrete optimization problems, including studying their performance through computational experiments. I mainly study algorithms that use Integer Programming and Decision Diagrams / Dynamic Programming. I use these algorithms to solve both benchmark instances and real-world instances of vehicle routing problems, scheduling problems, and humanitarian logistics problems.

I intend to graduate in May 2025, and I am excited to start looking for jobs.

My hobbies include [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/anthonykarahalios), [dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbIy6a7k4do), [poetry](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46446/still-i-rise), [athletics](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/52448#resultSetId-281040;perpage:100), [podcasting](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1890697), and [piano](https://www.youtube.com/user/amkarahalios).

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to reach out!
