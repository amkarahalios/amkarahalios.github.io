Welcome to my home page. I am currently working on my 1st Year Summer Paper, one of the first milestones to receiving a Tepper PhD. I am working with Professor Willem-Jan van Hoeve on an algorithm that uses decision diagrams to find the chromatic number of a graph.

My research interests are mainly in combinatorial optimization and integer programming.

My hobbies include chess, dance, sports, poetry, and piano.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to reach out!
