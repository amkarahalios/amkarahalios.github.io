I am an Operations Research scientist and software developer. I enjoy researching optimization methodologies, teaching optimization courses, and writing software that uses optimization to solve real-world problems. 

My journey:
1. MIP Engineer at OptiLogic (2025-)
   - Solving MIPs for Supply Chain design problems.
2. Ph.D in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization from Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business (2020-2025)
   - Researched models and methods for solving discrete optimization problems. I was advised by the amazing [Willem-Jan van Hoeve](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/van-hoeve-willem-jan.html). [Dissertation slides](https://amkarahalios.github.io/files/Karahalios-Dissertation-Defense-2025.pptx).
3. Quantiative Developer for Marshall Wace Asset Management (2017-2020)
   - Built a treasury optimization system and improved the automated trading system.
4. B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins University (2014-2017)
   - Solved umpire crew scheduling problems for Minor League Baseball.

My research:
1. Model relaxations and exact methods.
   - My dissertation received the Gerald L. Thompson Doctoral Dissertation Award in Management Science for 2025.
   - "Column Elimination: An Iterative Approach to Solving Arc Flow Formulations" is a finalist for the TSL Best Student Paper Award 2025.
   - "Column Elimination For Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems" was awarded Best Student Paper at CPAIOR in 2023.
2. Computation.
   - "From cliques to colorings and back again" develops a state-of-the-art SAT solver for the vertex coloring problem.
   - "A Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimization Algorithm for the First Responder Network Design Problem" is a quantum approach to solving a network design problem.
   - Work-in-progress "Computing a Nonnegative Dyadic Solution to a System of Linear Equations" is the first implementation of a dyadic linear programming solver.
3. Algorithm portfolios.
   - "Variable ordering for decision diagrams: A portfolio approach" tries to allocate limited runtime to several heuristics with unknown performance.

Fun things:
1. I host a podcast called [Optimizing You](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1890697).
2. I won a charity competition at Marshall Wace to support the [All Stars Project Development School for Youth](https://allstars.org/our-work/programs/development-school-for-youth/).
3. I work as a freelancer solving optimization problems on [Upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~019b8adcf84c4cd492?mp_source=share).
4. I am a former president of the [CMU INFORMS Student Chapter](https://cmuinforms.org/) and former chair of the student-run [YinzOR Conference](https://yinzor.cmuinforms.org/program/).
5. I am a former president of the [Hopkins Undergraduate Society of Applied Mathematics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/academics/undergraduate-studies/hopkins-undergraduate-society-for-applied-mathematics-husam/).
6. I am a math tutor for local high school students.
7. I recently completed my first triathlon.
