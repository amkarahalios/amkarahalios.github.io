Hi - my name is Anthony Karahalios. In Fall 2020, I started in the [Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO) PhD program](https://aco.math.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am very fortunate to be advised by the wonderful [Willem-Jan van Hoeve](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/van-hoeve-willem-jan.html).

I research the use of Decision Diagrams / Dynamic Programming and Integer Programming for solving combinatorial optimization problems like Vehicle Routing Problems and Scheduling.

My hobbies include [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/anthonykarahalios), [dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbIy6a7k4do), [poetry](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46446/still-i-rise), [athletics](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/52448#resultSetId-281040;perpage:100), [podcasting](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1890697), and [piano](https://www.youtube.com/user/amkarahalios).

I am honored to have received the NSF GRFP in 2022.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to reach out!
