I am an Operations Research scientist and software developer. I enjoy researching optimization methodologies, teaching optimization, and writing software that uses optimization to solve real-world problems. In particular, I am interested in comparing and constrasting the performance of different models and methods for solving discrete optimization problems.

My journey:
1. MIP Engineer at OptiLogic (2025-)
   - Solving MIPs for Supply Chain design problems.
2. Ph.D in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization from Carnegie Mellon University (2020-2025)
   - Developed a novel discrete optimization method that performs well on large-scale vehicle routing problems. I was advised by [Willem-Jan van Hoeve](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/van-hoeve-willem-jan.html). These are the [slides](https://amkarahalios.github.io/files/Karahalios-Dissertation-Defense-2025.pptx) from my dissertation defense.
3. Quantiative Developer for Marshall Wace Asset Management (2017-2020)
   - Built a treasury optimization system and improved the automated trading system.
4. B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins University (2014-2017)
   - Solved umpire crew scheduling problems for Minor League Baseball.

Fun things:
1. I host a podcast called [Optimizing You](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1890697).
2. I won a charity competition at Marshall Wace to support the [All Stars Project Development School for Youth](https://allstars.org/our-work/programs/development-school-for-youth/).
3. I work as a freelancer solving optimization problems on [Upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~019b8adcf84c4cd492?mp_source=share).
4. I am a former president of the [CMU INFORMS Student Chapter](https://cmuinforms.org/) and former chair of the student-run [YinzOR Conference](https://yinzor.cmuinforms.org/program/).
5. I am a former president of the [Hopkins Undergraduate Society of Applied Mathematics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/academics/undergraduate-studies/hopkins-undergraduate-society-for-applied-mathematics-husam/).
6. I am a math tutor for local high school students.
7. I recently completed my first triathlon.
