Hi - you can call me Anthony. I started my PhD in Fall 2020 at Carnegie Mellon University. I am very fortunate to be advised by the wonderful Professor Willem-Jan van Hoeve. I was recently awarded an NSF GRFP!

I can breakdown my research interests into methodologies and applications. For methodologies, I study combinatorial optimization, integer programming, and dynamic programming (decision diagrams). For applications, I study Graph Coloring, Scheduling, and Vehicle Routing Problems.

My hobbies include chess, dance, poetry, athletics, and piano.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to reach out!
