Welcome to my home page. I started my PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2020. I am very fortunate to be advised by the wonderful Professor Willem-Jan van Hoeve. I was also recently awarded the NSF GRFP!

My research interests for methodology are combinatorial optimization, integer programming, and dynamic programming (decision diagrams). Applications that I study include Graph Coloring, Scheduling, and Vehicle Routing Problems.

My hobbies include chess, dance, poetry, athletics, and piano.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to reach out!
