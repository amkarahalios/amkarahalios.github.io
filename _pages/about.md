I am an Operations Research scientist and software developer. I enjoy researching optimization methodologies, teaching optimization courses, and writing software that uses optimization to solve real-world problems. 

My journey:
1. MIP Engineer at OptiLogic (2025-)
   - Solving MIPs for Supply Chain design problems.
2. Ph.D in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization from Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business (2020-2025)
   - Researched models and methods for solving discrete optimization problems. I was advised by the amazing [Willem-Jan van Hoeve](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/faculty-and-research/faculty-by-area/profiles/van-hoeve-willem-jan.html).
   - Supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program
3. Quantiative Developer for Marshall Wace Asset Management (2017-2020)
   - Built a treasury optimization system and improved the automated trading system.
4. B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins University (2014-2017)
   - Solved umpire crew scheduling problems for Minor League Baseball.

My research:
1. Model relaxations and exact methods.
   - My [dissertation](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Column_Elimination_Iterative_Refinement_for_Solving_Arc_Flow_Formulations/29414666) focused on developing a new exact method that computes dual bounds for large-scale discrete optimization problems with a particular form. [slides](https://amkarahalios.github.io/files/Karahalios-Dissertation-Defense-2025.pptx).
      - Gerald L. Thompson Doctoral Dissertation Award in Management Science (2025).
   - [Column Elimination: An Iterative Approach to Solving Arc Flow Formulations](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/vanhoeve/papers/column_elimination.pdf)
      - With Willem-Jan van Hoeve.
      - Major Revision at Operations Research.
      - Finalist for the TSL Best Student Paper Award (2025).
   - [Column Elimination For Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10560260)
      - With Willem-Jan van Hoeve.
      - Published in CPAIOR conference proceedings (2023).
      - Best Student Paper at CPAIOR.
2. Computation.
   - [From cliques to colorings and back again](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10357179) develops a state-of-the-art SAT solver for the vertex coloring problem.
      - With Marijn Heule and Willem-Jan van Hoeve.
      - Published in Constraint Programming conference proceedings (2022).
   - [A Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimization Algorithm for the First Responder Network Design Problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12463) is a quantum approach to solving a network design problem.
      - With Sridhar Tayur, Ananth Tenneti, Amirreza Pashapour, Sibel Salman, and Baris Yildiz.
      - Published in INFORMS Journal on Computing (2025).
   - Work-in-progress "Computing a Nonnegative Dyadic Solution to a System of Linear Equations" is the first implementation of a dyadic linear programming solver.
3. Algorithm portfolios.
   - [Variable ordering for decision diagrams: A portfolio approach](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10357176) tries to allocate limited runtime to several heuristics with unknown performance.
      - With Willem-Jan van Hoeve.
      - Published in Constraints (2022).

Fun things:
1. I host a podcast called [Optimizing You](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1890697).
2. I won a charity competition at Marshall Wace to support the [All Stars Project Development School for Youth](https://allstars.org/our-work/programs/development-school-for-youth/).
3. I work as a freelancer solving optimization problems on [Upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~019b8adcf84c4cd492?mp_source=share). Some projects involved staffing nurses in hospitals, scheduling youth basketball leagues, and planning construction projects!
4. I am a former president of the [CMU INFORMS Student Chapter](https://cmuinforms.org/) and former chair of the student-run [YinzOR Conference](https://yinzor.cmuinforms.org/program/).
5. I am a former president of the [Hopkins Undergraduate Society of Applied Mathematics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/academics/undergraduate-studies/hopkins-undergraduate-society-for-applied-mathematics-husam/).
6. I am a math tutor for local high school students.
7. I recently completed my first triathlon.
