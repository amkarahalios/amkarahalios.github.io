TA for MBA Optimization course that focuses on developing such optimization models for operational and strategic decision making. We will consider applications such as resource allocation, network design, and capacity planning, in a variety of business areas including finance, operations, logistics, and marketing. We will primarily focus on deterministic optimization models (i.e., we don't use probability models or stochastic processes), and use linear, integer, and nonlinear programming as optimization methodologies. We solve problems in these fields using CPLEX in Python.
