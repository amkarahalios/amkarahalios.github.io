Professor for upper-level undergraduate optimization elective course. Fulfilled my teaching requirement for Tepper PhD students by teaching this class of 22 students. The course material includes column generation, integer programming, robust optimization, and a project where teams use these advanced modeling techniques to solve a real world problem. Models are implemented in both Excel and Python using Gurobi.
