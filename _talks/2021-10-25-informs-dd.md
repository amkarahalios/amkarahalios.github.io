A decision diagram approach was recently introduced to generate lower bounds
for the graph coloring problem. It uses compilation via iterative refinement,
which requires a variable ordering to be specified in advance. Oftentimes no
single variable ordering dominates all others for a set of problem instances. This
work provides an analysis and experimental evaluation of different variable
ordering strategies including using portfolios of variable orderings.
