We introduce subset-row inequalities into column elimination. These inequalities are notoriously challenging to implement in related branch-and-cut-and-price methods. We show how these inequalities can be implemented in column elimination in a weakened form that differs from the one used in branch-and-cut-and-price. We show computational results to demonstrate this difference.
