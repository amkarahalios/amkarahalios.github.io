Abstract. We present an exact algorithm for graph coloring and maximum clique problems based on SAT
technology. It relies on four sub-algorithms that alternatingly compute cliques of larger size and
colorings with fewer colors. We show how these techniques can mutually help each other: larger
cliques facilitate finding smaller colorings, which in turn can boost finding larger cliques. We evaluate
our approach on the DIMACS graph coloring suite. For finding maximum cliques, we show that our
algorithm can improve the state-of-the-art MaxSAT-based solver IncMaxCLQ, and for the graph
coloring problem, we close two open instances, decrease two upper bounds, and increase one lower
bound.
