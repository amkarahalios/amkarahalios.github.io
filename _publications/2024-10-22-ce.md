excerpt: 'We present column elimination as a general framework for solving (large-scale) integer programming problems. Our experimental evaluation shows that column elimination can be competitive with or outperform state-ofthe-art methods on various problem domains. Specifically, we find that column elimination closes five open
instances of the graph multicoloring problem, one open instance with 1,000 locations of the vehicle routing
problem with time windows, and six open instances of the pickup-and-delivery problem with time windows.'
